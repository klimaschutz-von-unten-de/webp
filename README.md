# webp - tool for automated image conversion to webp

Todays internet browsers support the webp format for a long time now.
However most of the images are stored using jpg or png file format. This
results in bigger image sizes and are today not necessary anymore.

The ksvu-webp tool uses the well known image processing tools gimp and
imagemagick to automize the converstion of existing jpg or png images to
the webp format by choosing the file with the smallest file size after
converting an image with both tools.
